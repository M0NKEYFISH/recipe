## Commands and how to do's

### 1) Git

- `git clone link-repository`: cloning locally (your machine) cloud repository;
- `git status`: showing the modified files;
- `git add`: adding modified files to the _staged changes_;
- `git commit -m "YOUR_MESSAGE"`: saving/committing your changes locally;
- `git diff`: seeing changes from modified files

#### 1.1) How to save/commit new changes and push them on the Cloud (using the terminal)

note: you can also use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to use a friendly interface. You can see how to do it [clicking here](https://zeroesandones.medium.com/how-to-commit-and-push-your-changes-to-your-github-repository-in-vscode-77a7a3d7dd02).

1. `git status` (To see the modified files - on _red_)
2. `git add FILE_NAME` (To add file to the _staged changes_. Remember to change FILE_NAME with the name of the file you have changed.)
3. `git status` (To see the modified files on staged changes - on _green_)
4. `git commit -m "YOUR_MESSAGE"` (To save/commit your changes locally. Remember to change YOUR_MESSAGE with the message that you wanna save with those changes.)
5. `git pull origin main` (To update your machine with changes from cloud - not required)
6. `git push origin main` (To update the cloud code (which it on GitHub))
